I.   Every single node in the tree must be either red or black.

II.  The root node of the tree must always be black.

III. Two red nodes can never appear consecutively, one after another; a red node must always be preceded by a black node (it must have a black parent node), and a red node must always have black children nodes.

IV.  Every branch path — the path from a root node to an empty (null) leaf node — must pass through the exact same number of black nodes.
